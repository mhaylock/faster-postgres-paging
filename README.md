# Faster Postgres Pagination Demonstration

This is a scrappy example Rails application that demonstrates how "Seek Method"
Pagination (also known as "Keyset Pagination") is faster than OFFSET based
pagination.

## Setup

Requires Ruby 3.0.2. Install dependencies using `bundle install`, then setup
database with:
```
$ bin/rails db:create db:schema:load db:seed
```
This will download the IMDB titles database using `bin/download_database` and
populate the `movies` table with movies from that database file.

## Running

To start:
```
bin/rails server
```

The relevant paths (assuming server is running on port 3000):
* [Unindexed OFFSET Pagination](http://localhost:3000/movies/unindexed)
* [Indexed OFFSET Pagination](http://localhost:3000/movies/indexed)
* [Seek / Keyset Pagination](http://localhost:3000/movies/seek)
* [Benchmarking All Three](http://localhost:3000/movies/benchmark)

## Notes

Benchmarking is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for the Movies to
be loaded into memory by ActiveRecord, so the times are not a direct benchmark
of Postgres but also include ActiveRecord and some other Ruby processing time.

Times are captured in the Rails MemoryStore cache, which is a complete hack and
only appropriate for the demonstration purposes used here ðŸ˜œ
